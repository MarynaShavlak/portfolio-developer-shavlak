## ‚öôÔ∏è Modular Partial Loading & Initialization

This project uses a modular system to dynamically load HTML partials and initialize their JavaScript functionality,
optimizing performance and maintainability.

- **Dynamic Partial Insertion**: Asynchronously fetches and injects HTML snippets into DOM containers using a reusable
  `insertPartial` function.
- **Section-Based Initialization**: Each partial has an associated initialization function (e.g., `initHeroSection`,
  `initPortfolio`) triggered after insertion.
- **Lazy Initialization on Scroll**: Deferred loading of some sections (Tools, Education, Reviews) improves initial load
  speed.
- **Centralized Configuration**: A single `sections` array manages selectors, file paths, init functions, and lazy-load
  flags.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Promises and try-catch blocks ensure smooth failure recovery.
- **Clean Separation**: HTML, CSS, and JS are compartmentalized by section, enhancing modularity.
