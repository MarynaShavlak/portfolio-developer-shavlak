## ‚öôÔ∏è Modular Partial Loading & Initialization

This project uses a modular system to dynamically load HTML partials and initialize their JavaScript functionality,
optimizing performance and maintainability.

- **Dynamic Partial Insertion**: Asynchronously fetches and injects HTML snippets into DOM containers using a reusable
  `insertPartial` function.
- **Section-Based Initialization**: Each partial has an associated initialization function (e.g., `initHeroSection`,
  `initPortfolio`) triggered after insertion.
- **Lazy Initialization on Scroll**: Deferred loading of some sections (Tools, Education, Reviews) improves initial load
  speed.
- **Centralized Configuration**: A single `sections` array manages selectors, file paths, init functions, and lazy-load
  flags.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Promises and try-catch blocks ensure smooth failure recovery.
- **Clean Separation**: HTML, CSS, and JS are compartmentalized by section, enhancing modularity.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Modular Partial Loading & Initialization

This project uses a modular system to dynamically load HTML partials and initialize their JavaScript functionality,
optimizing performance and maintainability.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Dynamic Partial Insertion**  
  HTML sections (partials) are loaded asynchronously into specified DOM containers via the reusable `insertPartial`
  function, which fetches and inserts HTML snippets.

- **Section-Based Initialization**  
  Each partial can have an associated init function (e.g., `initHeroSection`, `initPortfolio`) that runs immediately
  after insertion to activate section-specific logic.

- **Lazy Initialization on Scroll**  
  Some sections (like Tools, Education, Reviews) are loaded lazily ‚Äî their init functions trigger only when the user
  scrolls near the relevant content, improving initial load speed.

- **Centralized Configuration**  
  A single `sections` array configures partial selectors, paths, init functions, and lazy-loading behavior, making it
  easy to add or modify sections.

- **Error Handling**  
  Promises and try-catch blocks gracefully handle loading or initialization errors, ensuring robustness.

- **Clean Separation**  
  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for each section are compartmentalized, supporting modular development and easier
  maintenance.
